//2.Full Encapsulation:if we declare all the dat mmbers and the methods private then it is called as full encapsulation.
     *Synonym fo rencapsulation is data hiding or info hiding.

    Advantages: 1.Data hiding.
                2.If we want twe can make class read only.i.e using the getters not setters to change the values.
                3.Security.
                4.Reusability.

//3.Inheritance:When one class acquires the properties and behaviour of another class is called as inheritance.
    Here the class which is acquiring the properties is called as child class or derived class or sub class.
    And the class who is giving the properties and behaviour is called as parent class or base class or super class.
